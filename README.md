# s5-zi-all
These are solutions for assignments for the university course "Information Security". I implemented some encoding and compression algorithms by myself. You can find theory and full task descriptions in file Urbanovich_Kodirovanie_informacii.pdf

**Please note that  projects s5-zi-2, s5-zi-3, s5-zi-4 have been implemented in compliance with code conventions, but refactoring for the others has not yet been carried out.**
